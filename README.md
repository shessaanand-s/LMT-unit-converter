# LMT Unit Converter

This is a simple but useful Python program I built to convert between units of **Length**, **Mass**, and **Temperature** from the command line. It's beginner-friendly and helps build a strong understanding of basic input handling, conditional logic, and string parsing in Python.

## Why did I make this?

I was learning Python and wanted to build something practical. Most unit converters are web-based or full GUI. I challenged myself to do it CLI interfaced like 100mm, 293.45kg, or 98.2F.

### This project gave me good practice with:
1) Working with conditional logic
2) Writing modular functions
3) Error handling
